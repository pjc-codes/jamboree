# Admission Chances Analysis and Prediction


This project demonstrates practical data science skills through the analysis of real student data from Jamboree, an institute that helps students secure admissions abroad.  
I explored how academic performance and profile factors impact admission chances and built a **Linear Regression model** to predict an individual’s probability of admission.  
It highlights proficiency in **EDA, statistical modeling, and interpretability of ML models** — key competencies for applied data science roles.

## Overview
The dataset represents student profiles and their corresponding chances of admission.  
The goal is to identify which factors matter most for admissions and to build a **predictive model** capable of estimating an applicant’s likelihood of acceptance.

This project follows a complete data science workflow — from data preparation to modeling and insight communication.

## Key Highlights
- Conducted end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) on student data.  
- Identified significant relationships between academic metrics and admission success.  
- Built a Linear Regression model using Scikit-learn to predict admission probability.  
- Interpreted model coefficients to understand the effect of each factor.  
- Presented actionable insights for improving student admission profiles.
